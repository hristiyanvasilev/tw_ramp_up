HAL
    - STCube HAL - new, Standard Peripheral Library - old
        - STCube HAL - improvements, simplifies porting code between sub-families.
    - To abstract away from GPIO memory locations, we use "handlers", which are
    "structs", whose references are used to point to real peripheral addresses.

6. GPIO management
    - MODERy - Port x configuration bits (y = 0..15). Configures the I/O mode:
        - 00: input mode (reset state)
        - 01: General purpose output mode
        - 10: Alternate function mode.
        - 11: Analog mode.
    - ODR - Output data register.
        - Example: to "pull" pin high, "set" the corresponding bit of the ODR.
    - IDR - Input data register.
    - Peripherals that use MCU pins need to have these pins configured always.
    - Output i/o port
        - GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OD (open drain): 0 in ODR activates N-MOS, 1 leaves the port in Hi-Z
        - GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_PP (push-pull): 0 in ODR activates N-MOS, 1 activates P-MOS
    - Unless otherwise required, leave the deafult GPIO pin frequency to low.
    - bit-banding reduces switching frequency.

Misc:
    - BOM - bill of material.
    - RCC - reset and clock controller.
    - System bus - connects system bus of core to bus matrix
    - DMA bus - connects AHB interface of DMA to the BusMatrix
    - Bus matrix - two masters(CPU, DMA) and four slaves (flash, sram, AHB1, AHB2)
    - Round-robin - simple scheduling algorithm, equal time slices without
    - priority structured in a ring buffer.
