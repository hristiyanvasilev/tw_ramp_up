Answered:
---------
- [X] "integrated peripherals of cores" - what is a peripheral with respect to the
core? Page 179

- [X] difference between "ports" and "pins" in STM32. In arduino each PORT is
controlled by three registers. Here there are 16 "pins" per "port"? Terminology
is different?

- [X] dark orange pin color in CubeMX meaning? (conflict?)

- [X] when re-generating code from CubeMX, the user code if being overwritten.
Where is the option to disable that? (seems different than what is described in
        the book)

- [X] Using the STM32 HAL or CMSIS HAL? (do we need special procedures to generate
        it?)

- [X] Pull-up/Pull-down Vdd/Vss page 185, Figure 4.

- [X] Hi-Z meaning?

- [X] Schmitt trigger meaning?

- [X] SEGGER J-LINK later?

- [X] Example scenario for GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OD

- [X] Do we lock pins using HAL_GPIO_LockPin?

- [X] Hard fault is always "automatically" raised? Potential issue with interrupts
      that are not handled and an unexpected fault is handled in a generic way?

- [X] Always pull-down with GPIO that generates interrupts? Is it related to the
"rising" or "falling" edge of the interrupt?

- [X] All pins between the two boundaries are mapped to the same EXTII line?
     (page 200)

- [X] best way to test protocols and peripherals? (use arduino as a second
        device?)

- [X] HwFlowCtl and OverSampling used frequently?

- [X] DMA is responsible for all interrupts?

- [X] How does DMA understand if it is a USART2 peripheral address? (need to
        show code)

- [X] The meaning of "bus" in the MCU is a "device" not just a "set of wires".

- [X] easiest way to see generated assembly?
