Questions section

1. "integrated peripherals of cores" - what is a peripheral with respect to the
core? Page 179

2. difference between "ports" and "pins" in STM32. In arduino each PORT is
controlled by three registers. Here there are 16 "pins" per "port"? Terminology
is different?

3. dark orange pin color in CubeMX meaning? (conflict?)

4. when re-generating code from CubeMX, the user code if being overwritten.
Where is the option to disable that? (seems different than what is described in
        the book)

5. Using the STM32 HAL or CMSIS HAL? (do we need special procedures to generate
        it?)
