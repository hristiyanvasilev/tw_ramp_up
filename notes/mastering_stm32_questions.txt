- [ ] Do we lock pins using HAL_GPIO_LockPin?

Answered:
---------
- [X] "integrated peripherals of cores" - what is a peripheral with respect to the
core? Page 179

- [X] difference between "ports" and "pins" in STM32. In arduino each PORT is
controlled by three registers. Here there are 16 "pins" per "port"? Terminology
is different?

- [X] dark orange pin color in CubeMX meaning? (conflict?)

- [X] when re-generating code from CubeMX, the user code if being overwritten.
Where is the option to disable that? (seems different than what is described in
        the book)

- [X] Using the STM32 HAL or CMSIS HAL? (do we need special procedures to generate
        it?)

- [X] Pull-up/Pull-down Vdd/Vss page 185, Figure 4.

- [X] Hi-Z meaning?

- [X] Schmitt trigger meaning?

- [X] SEGGER J-LINK later?
