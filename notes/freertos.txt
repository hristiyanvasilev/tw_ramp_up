- Definition - real-time kernel, on which applications can built to meet hard real-time requirements.
               allows applications to be organized as separate threads of execution.
               (NOTE: cannot do multiple processes at the same time)
- Deadlines
    - soft deadline - not meeting the deadline does not render the system to be useless.
                      Example: system might slow down, but does not stop
    - hard deadline - breaching the deadline will result in absolute system failure.
                      In the most simplistic case threads with higher priority for important tasks.
                      Example: airbag system has potential to do more harm than good if it fails
                               to deploy itself after failure to meet deadline.
