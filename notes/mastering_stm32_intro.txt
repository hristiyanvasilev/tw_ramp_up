1. Introduction to STM32 MCU portfolio
    - STM32F0 line - low cost 32 bit MCUs, price comparable to 8 bit MCUs but superior features.
    - bootloader uses AES to encrypt the firmware
    - ARM refers to both:
        - families of RISC "architectures" (describes a machine, example: ARMv7-M):
            - instruction set and cycles.
            - execution model.
            - memory organization and layout.
        - families of "complete cores". (based on architecture revisions, example: core Cortex-M4, implementing ARMv7-M)
            - based on architecture
            - integrated peripherals (Q: what is that?)
            - hardware capabilities.
